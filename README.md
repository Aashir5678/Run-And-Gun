# Run-And-Gun
2D Run and gun game im making using pygame

99 % of the assets are from [this](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-pixel-prototype-character-sprites-for-shooter/) free sprite website

A and D are to move forwards and backwards, hold left shift while moving to sprint, space to do a flip,
hold right click to aim then left click to shoot, or don't aim and spray shoot.


Press R to reload. Hold C to crouch, and while holding C press X to go prone. If an enemy gets too close, press F to melee attack which flings them away from you.

While sprinting, let go of D and hold C to slide. Sliding in to enemies deals damge and flings them.


Your stamina and health go up faster when crouching / lying, and getting shot in the head / shooting enemies in the head will
deal more damage than shots in the body and legs.

Enemies will try to move closer to you to get a better shot, look out for grenades too.
